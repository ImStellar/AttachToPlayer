# AttachToPlayer

A mod to attach yourself to another player or orbit them

How To Use?

Click on any user and select Attach Util, from there there you can toggle each button for various attachments. If you want to stop being attached to them press either Space on your keyboard or your Right Controller Menu Button for VR users(sorry lefties)

Bugs

The only bugs so far are UI bugs such as when you open the nested button and select someone else it will not close it resulting in an overlap of UI to fix all you have to do is go back into the nested button.

UI
I used Ruby Button API to make the buttons.
