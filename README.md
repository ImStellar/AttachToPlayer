# AttachToPlayer

A mod to attach yourself to another player or orbit them

# How To Use?

Click on any user and select Attach Utils, from there you can toggle each button for various attachments. If you want to detach from them press either Space on your keyboard or your Right Controller Menu Button for VR users(sorry lefties)

# UI
I used Requi's UI to make the buttons.
